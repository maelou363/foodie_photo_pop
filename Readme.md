## What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?

The goal of the Foodie Photo Pop project was to have a place that a potential customer can land on and make it easy for them to view the companies work and get in contact with. It's clean design
that puts the portfolio of the photographer front and center. 'Walking the talk' was my thinking for this project. You can see what the work the photographer has done and intrigue the potential customer to reach out asking about services. I specifically left the services information vague so that it would jump start a conversation between the business and potential customer.

This was my first of four Milestone Projects that are a part of the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Insitute. That requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of three pages using HTML and CSS.

# Deployment

This application was developed in multiple editors, Gitpod and vsCode, and version controlling was utilised via local (git) and online (github) repository technologies.

Deploying this application was achieved through Github pages by:

* Selecting the Repository from my list in the Github Dashboard.
* Navigating to "Settings" and to the "Github Pages" section.
* From the "Source" section, click on the dropdown and select "main" branch from the associated list.
* Once "main" branch is selected, the page will auto-refresh and navigate the user to the top of the page with a visual ribbon display detailing, "Github pages source saved", indicating the success of the deployment.
* The link to the website can then be found under the "Github Pages" section, with a ribbon notification stating:
    "Your site is published at "https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/"


To clone the website:

Select the Repository from the Github Dashboard.
* Click on the "Clone or download" green button located above and to the right of the "Add file" button.
* Click on the "clipboard icon" to the right of the Git URL to copy the web URL of the Clone.
* Open your preferred editor/IDE and navigate to the terminal window.
* Type `git clone <paste-clone-url-here>` and press "Enter/Return" on your keyboard.
* This will create a clone of the project for you.
