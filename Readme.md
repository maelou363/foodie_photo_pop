# Design

### 1. Font

Throughout this project the below fonts are used to promote a friendly and appealing nature. Both fonts are sans serif typefaces, with a backup font of `sans-serif`, in case of any particular font not rendering as expected. They both greatly compliment each other, with "Luckiest Guy" giving a 1950s advertisement custom hand lettering feel for our headers and "Poppins" bringing a more geometric sans-serif typeface allowing for increased human readability and enhanced eye-tracking on screens.

- Headings - <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald?preview.text_type=custom">Oswald</a>
- Body - <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.text_type=custom">Poppins</a>

### 2. Color Scheme

Our color scheme is inspired by St.Patrick's day and muted tones. Allowing for constrating elements to be defined by the user with ease and promoting good User Experience amongst the site.

- ![#7FB8C7](https://placehold.it/15/7FB8C7/000000?text=+) `#7FB8C7` - Primary color
- ![#90C2BE](https://placehold.it/15/90C2BE/000000?text=+) `#90C2BE` - Secondary color
- ![#D5977D](https://placehold.it/15/D5977D/000000?text=+) `#D5977D` - Tertiary color
- ![#F7DED3](https://placehold.it/15/F7DED3/000000?text=+) `#F7DED3` - Supplementary color
- ![#EEF5F7](https://placehold.it/15/EEF5F7/000000?text=+) `#EEF5F7` - Supplementary color 2
- ![#7F7F7F](https://placehold.it/15/7F7F7F/000000?text=+) `#7F7F7F` - Supplementary color 2

## 4. Wireframing & Proposed/Implemented Functionality per Page

Wireframes for this project were created using Sketch, for small and large viewports. Each element was structurally planned out before building the project to allow us to build to a plan saving on time and potential bottlenecking via scope creep.

# Deployment

This application was developed in multiple editors, Gitpod and vsCode, and version controlling was utilised via local (git) and online (github) repository technologies.

Deploying this application was achieved through Github pages by:

* Selecting the Repository from my list in the Github Dashboard.
* Navigating to "Settings" and to the "Github Pages" section.
* From the "Source" section, click on the dropdown and select "main" branch from the associated list.
* Once "main" branch is selected, the page will auto-refresh and navigate the user to the top of the page with a visual ribbon display detailing, "Github pages source saved", indicating the success of the deployment.
* The link to the website can then be found under the "Github Pages" section, with a ribbon notification stating:
    "Your site is published at "https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/"


To clone the website:

Select the Repository from the Github Dashboard.
* Click on the "Clone or download" green button located above and to the right of the "Add file" button.
* Click on the "clipboard icon" to the right of the Git URL to copy the web URL of the Clone.
* Open your preferred editor/IDE and navigate to the terminal window.
* Type `git clone <paste-clone-url-here>` and press "Enter/Return" on your keyboard.
* This will create a clone of the project for you.
